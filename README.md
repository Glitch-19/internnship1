# NEURAL_LINK: Futuristic LinkedIn Clone

A state-of-the-art professional networking platform powered by the **Groq Llama-3.1 AI** and a high-performance **FastAPI** backend with a futuristic **React** HUD interface.

## 🚀 Vision
NEURAL_LINK revolutionizes professional networking by transforming static experience into dynamic "Neural Profiles" and simulating a global Hive Connect grid.

## 🛠 Features Implemented

### 1. Unified Neural Core (Backend)
- **FastAPI Framework**: High-performance asynchronous API endpoints.
- **Groq AI Integration**: Uses `llama-3.1-8b-instant` for generating professional LinkedIn-style profiles, InMails, and viral content.
- **SQLite Persistence**: Local relational database for storing profiles, messages, and job listings.
- **NetworkX Graph**: Mathematical mapping of professional connections (nodes and edges).

### 2. Profile Synth (AI Generation)
- **Direct Asset Upload**: Support for local image file uploads (`multipart/form-data`).
- **Profile Generation**: Converts raw career data into structured JSON and beautiful Markdown summaries.
- **Automated Seeding**: System automatically synths profiles for well-known CEOs (Elon Musk, Satya Nadella, etc.) on startup.

### 3. Hive Connect (Networking)
- **Verified Profiles**: Local database profiles appear with a "Verified" tag in search.
- **Quantum Scan**: Search for professionals by name or role with real-time profile preview.
- **Neural Connections**: Establish "Links" with other nodes in the system.
- **AI InMail**: Context-aware messaging generated by AI to facilitate outreach.

### 4. Career Grid (Job Search)
- **Recruiter Mode (Deploy Node)**: Companies can post new job listings directly to the grid.
- **Neural Job Search**: Filter and locate high-level opportunities across the ecosystem.
- **Direct Application**: Sync your neural profile with companies at the click of a button.

### 5. Cyber HUD (Frontend)
- **Futuristic UI**: Dark-mode aesthetic with "Cyber" HUD elements and glass-morphism.
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and transitions between neural tabs.
- **Lucide Icons**: High-fidelity iconography for system functions.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Real-time rendering of AI-generated profiles and posts.
